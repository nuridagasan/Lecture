package DataTypes

/**
 * Groovy offers a wide variety of built-in data types.
 Following is a list of data types which are defined in Groovy −
 * byte − This is used to represent a byte value. An example is 2.
 * short − This is used to represent a short number. An example is 10.
 * int − This is used to represent whole numbers. An example is 1234.
 * long − This is used to represent a long number. An example is 10000090.
 * float − This is used to represent 32-bit floating point numbers. An example is 12.34.
 * double − This is used to represent 64-bit floating point numbers
 which are longer decimal number representations which may be required at times. An example is 12.3456565.
 * char − This defines a single character literal. An example is ‘a’.
 * Boolean − This represents a Boolean value which can either be true or false.
 * String − These are text literals which are represented in the form of chain of characters.
 For example “Hello World”.
