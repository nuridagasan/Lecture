/**
 * <p>
 * We want to defer the construction of time-consuming objects until we actually
 * need them. We can be lazy and productive at the same time, write less code,
 * and reap all the benefits of lazy initialization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the next example we want to postpone the creation of the instances of {@code Heavy}
 * until theyâ€™re needed. We can directly initialize instances at the point of declaration
 * or we can wrap the logic for creation within a closure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code @Lazy} annotation provides a painless way to implement the virtual proxy
 * pattern with thread safety as a bonus.
